>***I convert plain text to cipher text by using Cryptocode library . Always Remember BDSEC is a KEY .***

We can find a hint from the problem name. So, python has a library named **cryptocode** used to encrypt and decrypt strings. In order to encrypt or decrypt the string we will need a key or password which is given as a hint in the problem statement. So, if we run the given **decoder.py** file with these information, we will get our flag.

>>>The flag is **BDSEC{cryp70_and_pyth0n_ar3_aw3s0me}**
