>***I found this mail in my mail spam folder. Can you help to understand this mail?***

We can see a spam mail in the given **fake.txt** file. We put the spam message into [this website](https://www.spammimic.com/) and decode it. We get the following message:

>**Hello Mr.Alex   I won't 100000 M USD dolor. Can  you want that, you need this key   BDSEC{do3sn't_b3li3ve_1n_unkn0wn_mail}**

So, yeah, we have our flag. Simple, isn't it? 

>**The flag is BDSEC{do3sn't_b3li3ve_1n_unkn0wn_mail}**
